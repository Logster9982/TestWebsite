<p style="color:grey;font-family:Arial">The Virginia Commonwealth has numerous departments to help with the many developments in Virginia, but in recent times, one has been more helpful then expected, the Health Department. The Mission of the Virginia Department of Health is to protect the health and promote the well-being of all people in Virginia.  They give accurate health information for free on public channels and create rulesets and policy for medical facilities. They link up with other orgs like the CDC for collaborative efforts.</p>

<p style="color:grey;font-family:Arial">This assignment took a short time, but the transition to the new sources was difficult. I had to find out how to link an external css to allow my website to load correctly. I also had to avoid many formatting issues I did not understand, making my code source look less than steller. I also forgot to comment after I paused my work for the day, resulting in me not knowing what I had done at all.
